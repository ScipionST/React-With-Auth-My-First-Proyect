# My first learning project
# Help me :B
It is just a project with the intention of opening an electric gate using an ESP8266, managing users, and seeing which users have used the opening system. I would like to implement robust security since it will be on a CPanel server. Depending on that, I might proceed with the intention of further expanding the project, potentially into an internal management system for quality control, tasks, and documents
